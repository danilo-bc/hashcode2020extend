# Google's HashCode 2020 solved using Julia language

This repository is being made public after HashCode 2020 has finished its preliminary competition phase.

# How to run
Simply using ```make -jN```, where N is the number of processors you have available, will be enough.

# How and Why
Made with Julia 1.13, partly as a way to exercise my initial studies with the language.
This code has been run on a Fedora 32 machine.

Use by your own discretion.
